# üåü Digital Twin of the FIE üåü

Welcome to the **Digital Twin of the Faculty of Engineering (FIE)** project!  
This repository hosts the complete solution for implementing a **real-time energy monitoring system** that leverages **IoT technologies**, **cloud data storage**, and an **interactive web interface** to optimize energy consumption management.

---

## üìñ Project Overview

The **Digital Twin** project aims to create a virtual representation of the **electrical energy consumption** in the Faculty of Engineering.  
It leverages **Photon microcontrollers** to collect data from various locations, sending this information via the **MQTT protocol** to a centralized **Linux server**.  
Data is then stored in a **PostgreSQL database** and visualized in real-time through an intuitive **web application built with React**.  

### üåê Objectives
- **Monitor electrical variables (voltage, current, power) in real time.**
- **Store data securely and efficiently for long-term analysis.**
- **Provide a dynamic and interactive dashboard for data visualization.**
- **Enable early detection of anomalies or irregular consumption patterns.**
- **Facilitate predictive analytics and trend analysis in future iterations.**

---

## üß© Key Features

### üî• Real-Time Data Monitoring
- Collection of **voltage (Vrms)**, **current (A)**, and **power (kW)** metrics.
- Real-time data transmission using **MQTT** protocol for minimal latency.

### üíæ Data Storage and Management
- Structured storage in **PostgreSQL** for reliable and consistent data handling.
- Historical data retention for trend analysis and report generation.

### üñ•Ô∏è Interactive Web Interface
- Developed using **React** with a modern and responsive design.
- Visualizes real-time data through **dynamic charts and graphs**.
- Allows customization of viewing preferences and data filtering.

### üîî Alerts and Notifications (Planned)
- Real-time notifications when abnormal patterns are detected.
- Configurable alert thresholds to detect potential overloads or anomalies.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project architecture follows a **modular and scalable approach**, integrating multiple technologies to ensure performance and flexibility.

```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (with npm or yarn) for the React application.  
- **PostgreSQL** installed and running.  
- **MQTT Broker** (e.g., Mosquitto) installed on a Linux server.  
- **Photon devices** configured to transmit data.

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository to your local environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/digital-twin-fie.git
cd digital-twin-fie
```
### 2. Server Configuration
Install MQTT Broker (Mosquitto) on Linux:
```bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
sudo systemctl start mosquitto
```
Test the Broker:

mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "test/topic"
3. Database Setup
Install PostgreSQL:

sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
Create Database and User:

sudo -u postgres psql
CREATE DATABASE energy_monitoring;
CREATE USER twin_admin WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE energy_monitoring TO twin_admin;
\q
Run Database Migrations:

cd server/db
psql -U twin_admin -d energy_monitoring -f create_tables.sql
4. Web Application Setup
Navigate to the Web Directory:

cd web
Install Dependencies:

npm install
Run the Application:

npm start
Visit http://localhost:3000 to access the dashboard.

## üí° Usage Instructions

Connect Photon Devices:
Ensure that all Photon sensors are properly configured and connected to the network.
Monitor Real-Time Data:
Use the web dashboard to view voltage, current, and power metrics in real-time.
Historical Data Analysis:
Generate reports and visualize past data trends using the historical view.
Anomaly Detection (Planned):
Configure alert thresholds for detecting irregular consumption patterns.

## üìù Troubleshooting

# Common Issues
Web Application Not Starting:
- Check if Node.js and npm are correctly installed.
```bash

node -v
npm -v
```
- Database Connection Error:
Verify that PostgreSQL is running and accessible:
```bash
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```
- MQTT Communication Failure:
  
Make sure the Mosquitto service is active:
```bash
sudo systemctl status mosquitto
```
